# Getting started

Run the following command in your terminal to start the application in development mode:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The --reload flag enables automatic server restarts whenever you make changes to the code, perfect for development.

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to: http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs

Here, you can interactively explore and test all available API endpoints!
