EDITING-DOUCUMENTATION: this is how I edited the code:

## 1:
1. I added a 404 HTTP status message that is executed when in DELETE course is passed a course_id that is not available. I have also edited and changed the solution with the 'found_value'.
2. I edited the DELETE endpoint and the associated helper function so that a solution with 'global' is no longer necessary.

## 2:
1. I added a PUT endpoint for courses and tested it. It works as expected.
2. I added a PUT endpoint for participants and tested it. It works as expected.
3. I also changed the structure and numbering of the tasks.
4. I have added the function that two courses with the same name cannot be added.
5. The functionality that a participant cannot be added more than once is already given, therefore changes were not necessary.
6. I have set up the timestamps for the courses and participants (I don't particularly like my solution, we can revise it).
7. I also added docstring.
